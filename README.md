# lsl-ue4
LabstreamingLayer plugin for Unreal Engine 4

This is completely unsupported. I have not used this in years and is here for reference only. It almost certainly doesn't work with the latest versions of UE4.

This plugin comes with an older version of liblsl (1.11) that is no longer supported. It should be updated to use newer liblsl.
